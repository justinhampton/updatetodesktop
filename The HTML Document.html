<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8"/>
  <title>The HTML Document</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>The !DOCTYPE Declaration</h1>
<p>Use as first line of all HTML documents. It tells your browser that it follows modern HTML stnadards.
    It's for legacy reasons, older webpages without this declaration are handled differently.
    It is not case sensitive, but DOCTYPE is usually CAPS, html is not</p>

<h2>THE html ELEMENT</h2>
<p>Start with the html lang tag to follow the !DOCTYPE document
    End tag should be the final line of the document. The lang attribute lets the browser know the language</p>

<h3>THE head ELEMENT</h3>
<p>metadata, data about data
    This data is used by the browser for information on how to display the webpage
    Always set meta charset = utf-8 and title elements
    The meta charset = utf-8 void element indicates character encoding used for document, set as first element inside head
    title has start and end tag with title text between, used for browser tab text and search engines
</p>

<h4>THE body ELEMENT</h4>
<p>Holds content of webpage visible to user
    Many different elements used in teh body, such as h1</p>

<h5>Structuring the HTML body</h5>
<p>Learning about different HTML elements such as p, div, section, article, header, footer, h1-h6,ol,ul, and li

    Also learning about HTML concepts such as Semantic HTML, block-level vs inline elements, and comments. These elements are not void elements
</p>

<h6>Some elements</h6>
<p>div is short for division, generic container of other elements. Can hold almost anything inside the body
    - text, images, video, even other divs.
    Div is non-semantic, it has no inherent meaning. Most elements are semantic, it's preferable to use semantic elements.
    Use div as a last resource when no other semantic element works

    p is the paragraph element, used mainly to contain text. Displayed with top and bottom margins, and you can't nest other p elements inside eachother

    section is similar to div but it's semantic, it indicates that the contents have a related subject matter, ex: movie theaters website may have a section on the homepage that lists new releases
    Otherwise it functions like a div in that it can hold any other element, including other div and other sections, typically has a header inside it

    h1-h6 stands for heading, there's 6 levels of these. Web browsers default h1 as the largest and h6 as the smallest
    Some people use h1-h6 to resize text, but you shouldn't. Use CSS for this. Use heading elements to structure webpages content menaingfully
    Accessibility, screenreaders look for headings to figure out parts of a webpage.
    In general, never use HTML for styling, that's the purpose of CSS

    ol, ul, and li
    Used to create two types of lists 
    ol is used for ordered lists 
    ul is for unordered lists 
    li is used along with both to define each list item
    Example" <ol reversed start=6>
        <li>Coconuts</li>
        <li>Mangos</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ol>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Coconuts</li>
        <li>Mangos</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>

    em and strong elements -
    Give extra meaning to text.
    em is short for emphasis, browsers will italize words
    Used to give <em>stressed emphasis to some text</em>
    Rule of thumb, if a screen reader should use extra verbal stress when reading certain words, use em

    Example: "I <em>know</em> you did it" vs. "I know <em>you</em> did it"

    strong
    Browsers will display as <strong>bold</strong>

    Use to give improtance to text, such as a warning message

    i and b were used in early html, before CSS, but this is no longer recommended because you should simply use CSS for style
    HTML is used for structure and meaning, not visual style. Use CSS for style 

    < ! -- Comments -- > are texted used in HTML document that will be ignored by the browser. Helpful notes for future self or for other coders
