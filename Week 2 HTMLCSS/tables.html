  <body>
    In early pre-CSS HTML, tables were often used to position content. Today,
    CSS is used to display data in a tabular format.

    <h1>Table</h1>
    <br />
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Title</th>
          <th>Author</th>
          <th>Year</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">Idoru</td>
          <td>William Gibson</td>
          <td>1996</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Crash</td>
          <td>JG Ballard</td>
          <td>2003</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br />
    <h1>Forms</h1>
    <p>Allow users to interact with websites to enter date</p>
    <p>
      Forms can be short (login, search) or long (advanced searched, more inputs
      and options)
    </p>
    <p>Usually data is sent to a server, which handles and sends a response</p>
    <p>
      Googles web server will retrieve search results and send them back to the
      browser, a shopping sites credit card info will try to validate a card,
      etc
    </p>
    <p>
      form is a container element, usually defines contents as a form. Input is
      a versatile element commonly used in forms
    </p>
    <p>basic form</p>
    <form>
      <input type="text" />
      <input type="submit" value="Go" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <p>
      in order to submit a form to a server you need a form action to send the
      data to and a method to get or post
    </p>
    <p>
      the action is a url on a server that should run a server-side script (a
      small program) to handle the form submission
    </p>
    <p>
      the method attribue is set to get or post, get to send requests to data
      from server such as a search query, and post is to send data to a server
      to both text and binary data such as images, any sensitive data needs to
      be encrypted such as passwords
    </p>
    <form action="https://learn.nucamp.co/show_everything.php" method="post">
      Enter your avatar name:
      <input type="text" name="avatarName" placeholder="Avatar Name" required />
      <input type="submit" value="Go" />
    </form>
    <br />
    <h1>Input attributes</h1>
    <p>type: text, submit, many others</p>
    <p>
      submit: submit button with inputs value as a button text, sends form data
      to a url specified in the form actions attribute
    </p>
    <p>
      name: required, single word, tells server what the data is. you need a
      name otherwise the input will be ignored, always include a name with an
      input
    </p>
    <p>value: default value to submit, also used for a submit button text</p>
    <p>placeholder:</p>
    <p>
      required: boolean, inputs with this attribute must be given a value before
      the form can be submitted
    </p>
    <p>
      checkbox & radio. select values, checkbox can select multiple radio can
      only select 1
    </p>
    <p>range: slider for a range between min and max values</p>
    <p>color: color picker</p>
    <p>
      file: file upload. when you upload a file you need to add
      enctype="multipart/formdata" to the forms start tag
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>checkbox/radio example:</p>
    <!--single checkbox input-->
    <div>Delivery?<input type="checkbox" name="Delivery" /></div>

    <!--Group of multiple checkbox inputs-->
    <div>
      Milk <input type="checkbox" name="groceries" value="milk" /> Eggs
      <input type="checkbox" name="groceries" value="eggs" /> Bread
      <input type="checkbox" name="groceries" value="bread" />
    </div>
    <!--Group of multiple radio inputs-->
    <div>
      Pay by Cash
      <input type="radio" name="payment" value="cash" required /> Pay by Check
      <input type="radio" name="payment" value="check" />
    </div>

    <h1>More form elements</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        fieldset: gives structure to contents of a form, group sets of form
        controls together
      </li>
      <li>
        legend: gives structure to contents of a form, set a caption at the top
        of a fieldset
      </li>
      <li>
        textarea: multi-line text input form control. control visible lines with
        rows attribute and width with cols attribute. always set name attribute,
        can set a placeholder but not value attribute; if you want default text,
        place between tags
      </li>
      <li>
        select & option: used together to create a dropdown list. similar to ol
        and li working together. select element contains a set of options, and
        requires a name attribute. each option surrounds a dropdown text option,
        each option requres a value attribute
      </li>
      <li>
        label: surround a forms control caption text in a label element.
        associate the label and form control by giving the label a for attribute
        and the form control an id attribute, then set the values to match. that
        way if the label is clicked or touched, the associated form control is
        focused. example label for first name paired with input type text id
        first name.
      </li>
    </ul>
